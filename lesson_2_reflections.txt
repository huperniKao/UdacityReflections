What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It initializes Git so you can keep a history and track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area allows you to plan and prepare how you want to commit certain changes, instead of having to save all at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    You can check with Git diff and git diff --staged
