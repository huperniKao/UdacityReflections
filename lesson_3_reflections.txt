When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you are working on more the one computer or if you are collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    You may not be ready to make changes, or you may only want to commit/change certain files, not all.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    forks allow you to "clone" someone else's repository without allowing you to push changes to it, but offer you an easy to suggest edits. clones allow you to make your own copy of a repository, either locally or remotely. Branches allow you to test new features by creating a separate instance of a current branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    If there is a bug or a mistake made, or some kind of change on the remote, this will allow you to have a backup copy to refresh from and compare the differences

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    I would most likely use Google Drive to collaborate. It's easier, in that google automatically saves and updates what you're working on. It can also keep track of changes made. The harder part is keeping track of separate versions or working offline.
